    "Jupyter Notebooks allow a user to read instructions and run code as if working in a command line terminal, but with an easy-to-use interface. When a new user logs in, a new working environment is created for that user based on an existing notebook (the tutorial). All data is saved for the user personally, so if you change things in this tutorial, you won't affect the tutorial experience that another user has.\n",
